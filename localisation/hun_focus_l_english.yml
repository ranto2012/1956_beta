 HUN_the_great_coalition:0 "The Great Coalition"
 HUN_the_great_coalition_desc:0 "In these turbulent times, our best bet is to try to stay neutral, and keep the country stable. To do this, we will need a strong government, that can pass the necessary reforms unopposed. The Bethlen-Peyer-pact of 1921 laid the fundations of this cooperation, but we will need to see it to its completion.

 HUN_women_in_the_army:0 "Women In The Army"
 HUN_women_in_the_army_desc:0 "Our country is small, and if we want to be able to defend it, we will need every resource available. By restricting conscription to men only, we are not only putting yet another restriction on women, we are also missing out on potential recruits. Though the decision may upset some of the more conservative officers, we must allow women in the army for the good of the country."
 HUN_social_reconciliation:0 "Social Reconciliation"

 HUN_tax_reform_desc:0 "The war caused immense suffering to many in our nation, but there are those, who got rich during the conflict, and rose above in the ranks of society after the war.

 HUN_education_reform:0 "Education Reform"

 HUN_liberal_ideas_desc:0 "Clearly, aligning ourselves to the germans has not been the right decision, as it was proven in the Great War. To ensure that we are never on the losing side again, we have to embrace the democratic ideas of the victors, in hope of gaining their support and protection."

 HUN_strengthen_the_move_desc:0 "The MOVE is a paramilitary organization, founded in part by Bajcsy-Zsilinszky, the purpose of which was to support the army, that was crippled by the restrictions set at Trianon. The group faded into relative obscurity over time, but it could be repopularized to boost national morale, and prepare the population for defending the country, if necessary."
 HUN_land_reform:0 "Land Reform"
 HUN_land_reform_desc:0 "Many of the farmlands in Hungary still have disputed ownership since the country shrank in size, and crown lands were redistributed.

 HUN_joining_the_right_cause_desc:0 "A stable, peaceful world is built on the solid foundation of democracy.

 HUN_allied_license_trade:0 "Allied License Trade"

 HUN_democratic_trade_focus:0 "Democratic Trade Focus"

 HUN_scientific_spirit:0 "Scientific Spirit"
 HUN_scientific_spirit_desc:0 "We may not have the numbers that the fascists have, but we may be able to make that up in technology. With close cooperation between our scientists, and the Allies', we can make breakthroughs earlier than alone, and perhaps even outmatch the fascists' efforts."

 HUN_ask_for_szekler_autonomy_desc:0 "The loss of Transylvania has left more than a million Hungarians outside of our borders.

 HUN_the_visegrad_group:0 "The Visegrád Group"
 HUN_the_visegrad_group_desc:0 "Hungary can not rely on far away powers to protect her, when the fascists come knocking.

 HUN_invite_yugoslavia:0 "Invite Yugoslavia"

 HUN_invite_austria:0 "Invite Austria"
 HUN_invite_austria_desc:0 "Austria is in a precarious position, being wedged between Germany and Italy. Without proper protection, they would quickly be swallowed by either one of these fascist giants. We should extend an invitation to them, and offer the protection of the Visegrád Group."
 HUN_baltic_expansion:0 "Baltic Expansion"
 HUN_baltic_expansion_desc:0 "We have successfully laid the foundations of a new alliance, but it still needs more members.

 HUN_economic_cooperation:0 "Economic Cooperation"
 HUN_economic_cooperation_desc:0 "Our alliance is what it is: a military alliance.

 HUN_joint_military_council:0 "Joint Military Council"
 HUN_joint_military_council_desc:0 "While individual members of our alliance might be powerful, the true potential of military allainces lies within cooperation. To make it easier for our armies to execute joint operations, we will establish a military board, which oversees these endavours."

 HUN_communist_ideas:0 "Communist Ideas"
 HUN_communist_ideas_desc:0 "Being overshadowed by the German Reich, and far away from the democratic liberals in the west, Hungary needs to seek protection elsewhere. Hungary is not at all unfamiliar with bolshevik ideals, as the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic rose to power in 1919.

 HUN_the_rakosi_administration:0 "The Rákosi Administration"

 HUN_create_the_avo:0 "Create The ÁVO"

 HUN_the_iron_curtain:0 "The Iron Curtain"
 HUN_the_iron_curtain_desc:0 "Nothing good ever comes from the capitalists and fascists in the west. We have to make an effort to isolate our people from the dangerous ideas they spread.

 HUN_goulash_communism_desc:0 "'Those who are not against us, are with us'. This is the philosophy we employ, when it comes to enemies of the system. The people will be kept in blissful welfare, which will make them more cooperative with the government. Prices of common consumer goods will be determined by the state, and they will always be available. This will no doubt incur extra costs, but it will keep the population content, and happy."
 HUN_modernize_the_railway_network:0 "Modernize The Railway Network"
 HUN_modernize_the_railway_network_desc:0 "The Hungarian railway is in dire need of improvement, as the restrictions set by the Trianon peace treaty forbode the construction of railways with more than one track.

 HUN_hungarian_research_cities_desc:0 "The Soviets have built entire towns and cities, where the primary work conducted is research and development of new technologies. We should try to do the same, and establish contact with their research groups, in order to share our knowledge."
 HUN_the_country_of_iron_and_steel:0 "The Country Of Iron And Steel"
 HUN_the_country_of_iron_and_steel_desc:0 "The Soviet Union is rich in natural resources, but less so in industrial capacity to process them.

 HUN_worker_spirit:0 "Worker Spirit"

 HUN_german_revolution_desc:0 "The greatest of our enemies, Germany is ready to jump at our throat. While taking a stand against them, and fighting them off would be a heroic feat indeed, we might just turn them to our side, if we play our cards right. A communist revolution in Germany would not only ensure our safety, but strenghten our ideals in Europe altogether, granted it would still be a costly endavour."
 HUN_italian_revolution:0 "Italian Revolution"
 HUN_italian_revolution_desc:0 "Now, that the fascists have been defeated in Germany, Italy has to be brought in line next. We will employ the same tactics as in Germany: worker strikes, support for the Italian communist party, and anti-fascist propaganda."

 HUN_armament_unificiation:0 "Armament Unification"
 HUN_armament_unificiation_desc:0 "The Warsaw Pact needs to be more than a formal cooperation of its members.

 HUN_concentrated_construction_effort:0 "Concentrated Construction Effort"
 HUN_concentrated_construction_effort_desc:0 "Our federation may be small, but it has great potential.

 HUN_federal_reserve_guard:0 "Federal Reserve Guard"

 HUN_suppression_focus:0 "Suppression Focus"
 HUN_suppression_focus_desc:0 "Total cooperation of the local population in newly acquired territories is necessary, if we wish to make use of them in the army.

 HUN_conscription_reforms_desc:0 "Outright extending conscription might couse public outrage, but if we carefully juggle with laws, we might still acquire a bigger pool of manpower.

 HUN_revisionist_education_desc:0 "Our education system has to embrace the ideas of revisionism, and pass on the spirit to the younger generations.

 HUN_invite_bulgaria:0 "Invite Bulgaria"
 HUN_invite_bulgaria_desc:0 "Bulgaria has served our cause in the Great War out of necessity more than friendship. Maybe they could do so again, if we strengthened our relationship with them a bit.
