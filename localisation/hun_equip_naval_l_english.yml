 HUN_destroyer_1:0 "Tátra Class"
 HUN_destroyer_1_desc:0 "(Historical) The most modern torpedo gunboat of the K.u.K kriegsmarine during the Great War. The first ship of the class began construction in 1911, and the last was handed over to the Navy in 1913. The ships received a strong artillery and torpedo armor on par with other ships of the era, with their water displacement at 1,000 tonnes with a full load, their speed reached 32 knots. After the end of the war, the destroyers were distributed among the victors, and later all of them were scrapped."
 HUN_destroyer_2:0 "Kajmán Class"
 HUN_destroyer_2_desc:0 "(Historical/Hypotethical) An upgrade of the old Tátra class on the basis of Ganz & Co.-Danubius-Fiume's 2,000-ton destroyer plans. Ships of this class have received stronger, more modern weaponry and torpedo weaponry, and have been better equipped to fight submarines. The displacement of fully loaded vessels reached 2,000 tons, but they maintained the excellent seaworthiness and high speed of the old Tátra class. It was considered to be a relatively small destroyer when measured to other destroyers of the era. The biggest disadvantage of the Kajmán class was the relatively small range."
 HUN_destroyer_3:0 "Csikós Class"
 HUN_destroyer_3_desc:0 "(Hypotethical) The Tátra and the Kajmán class ships were perfectly suited to the Adriatic Maritime operations, but the fleet faced the need for a larger and more powerful armed destroyer that could not be used only on the Adriatic. Thus, based on the German and Italian torpedo destroyers of the time, an armored destroyer model with a displacement of 3,500 tons was developed, equipped with standard sonar equipment for use against the submarines."
 HUN_destroyer_4:0 "Huszár Class"
 HUN_destroyer_4_desc:0 "(Hypotethical) A Significant Improvement of the Csikós class, with reinforced anti-aircraft and torpedo weaponry. Ships of this class have been fitted with more modern sonar and radar equipment. Their range has been significantly increased by incorporating more modern diesel engines and larger fuel tanks."
 
 HUN_light_cruiser_1:0 "Novara Class"
 HUN_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "(Historical) The Novara class ships were built between 1911 and 1915 for the K.u.K Kriegsmarine. These high-speed light cruisers, equipped with powerful artillery and torpedo weapons, were used in a number of battles during the Great War. After the end of the war, the ships were distributed among the victors, and later all of them were scrapped.

 HUN_light_cruiser_2:0 "Zenta Class"
 HUN_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "(Historical/Hypotethical) After the recovery of the Adriatic coast, the design engineers of the Ganz Danubius Shipyard, used the plans of the old Monarchy Ersatz Senta class, and radically redesigned them, giving birth to a new light cruiser. The goal was to develop a well-protected, lightweight, 7,000-tonne displacement cruiser for coastal defense and escort missions. Though its main weapon were only six 150 mm guns divided into three towers, its duplicate 80 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns, and the numerous 40-mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns made it the ideal anti-air cruiser."
 HUN_light_cruiser_3:0 "Báthori Class"
 HUN_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "(Hypotethical) Based on the plans of the Duca degli Abruzzi light cruiser, designers at the Ganz Danubius shipyard created the prototype of the Báthori Class. Compared to the original plans, it received a stronger anti-aircraft armaments and armor."
 HUN_light_cruiser_4:0 "Zombor Class"
 HUN_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "(Hypotethical) A significant upgrade of the Báthori class, the Zombor class has been strengthened with air defense armaments and modern radar systems. To achieve a longer reach, a completely new engine was designed, which significantly reduced fuel consumption."
 
 HUN_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Sankt Georg Class"
 HUN_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "(Historical) The SMS Sankt Georg armored cruiser was built between 1901 and 1903 for the K.u.K. Kriegsmarine.

During the war, it participated in several missions, and it was the base of the 1918 sailor uprising. After the war, the ship was scrapped by the Allies."
 HUN_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Rákóczi Class"
 HUN_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "(Historical/Hypotethical) The design of the Technical Committee of the Navy 1918's Project VII Heavy Cruiser was redesigned based on plans for the Zara and Hipper class heavy cruisers, giving rise to the Rákóczi class cruisers, being both well protected, and well armed. Its weaponry, due to its high speed and range, was intended primarily for the destruction of enemy convoys and the escort of larger ships."
 HUN_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Budapest Class"
 HUN_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "(Hypotethical) Further development of the Rákóczi class has strengthened air defense on the basis of war experiences. The Budapest class was also equipped with a radar system."
 HUN_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Hadik Class"

 HUN_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Projekt VI Schlachtkreuzer"
 HUN_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "(Historical) The K.u.K. Kriegsmarine did not have battlecruisers during the Great War, but made a number of plans, none of which were completed until the end of the war. The VI Plan is the latest and most ambitious plan for all of them. The ship's displacement was planned to be 32,000-36,000 tons, its armor at 100-220 mm, while the main weapon turrets up to 440 mm. According to the plans, it was to be equipped with an extremely strong primary and secondary weapon with which it would be a worthy opponent of any of the warships of the era. The Schlachtkreuzer's disadvantages were the weak inboard armor and the relatively weak air defense armaments."
 HUN_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Radetzky Class"
 HUN_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "(Hypotethical) Based on the German Scharnhorst model, the Radetzky class was designed for long-range operations, being equipped with the necessary radar equipment, and heavy armaments. With a water displacement of 40,000 tons, this battlecruiser would have been a mighty opponent on the seas. Plans for this class also included extensive amounts of anti-air guns."
 
 HUN_battleship_1:0 "Tegetthoff Class"
 HUN_battleship_1_desc:0 "(Historical) The Tegetthoff class was a battleship of the K.u.K. Kriegsmarine, with a water displacement of 20,000 tons. The only Hungarian-built battleship, the St. Stephen, which was built on the 29th of January, 1912, was also a member of this class.

The basic, 24,000 ton displacement plan went through several iterations, and in the latest plan, an extremely powerful armored battleship designed for 40,000 tons was featured."
 HUN_battleship_3:0 "Hunyadi Class"
 HUN_battleship_3_desc:0 "(Hypotethical) Using the latest designs of the Ersatz Monarch class and re-designing it, 40,000-45,000 tons of water displacement was planned for a ship with immense firepower, which, would have had extremely strong armor and would have been equipped with a large amount of additional air defense armaments for fighting in the Mediterranean."
 HUN_battleship_4:0 "Kinizsi Class"
 HUN_battleship_4_desc:0 "(Hypotethical) A design based on the German Bismarck and Tirpitz battleships, the Kinizsi would have had a water displacement of 50,000 tonnes, eight 380 mm main guns, strong secondary and anti-aircraft weapons and a modern radar."
 
 HUN_SH_battleship_1:0 "Szent István Class"
 HUN_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "(Hypotethical) A radical rework of the plans for the 40,000-tonne battleship of the Ersatz Monarch class. According to the plans, a 50,000-60,000 tonne displacement, high-speed and large-scale warship was toi be built."
 HUN_SH_battleship_2:0 "Szent László Class"
 HUN_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "(Hypotethical) A more ambitious plan than the Szent István class, in which a minimum of 80,000 tonnes of water displacement battleship was designed to strengthen the fleet."
 
 HUN_carrier_1:0 "Carpathia Class"
 HUN_carrier_1_desc:0 "(Hypotethical) The Carpathia class is a lightweight, 18,000 tonne displacement aircraft carrier designed to provide airborne cover for convoys and larger fleets. The plans included relatively thin armor, small amounts of aircraft, with the aim being the creation of a low-cost carrier, that could be built on the basis of existing commercial ships."
 HUN_carrier_2:0 "Pannónia Class"
 HUN_carrier_2_desc:0 "(Hypotethical) An airplane carrier designed on the basis of the German Graf Zeppelin class. The heavy armaments in the original plans have been abandoned and replaced by a larger hangar to transport a larger amount of airplanes."
 HUN_carrier_3:0 "Tomori Class"

HUN_submarine_2:0 "Csuka Class"
HUN_submarine_2_desc:0 "(Hypotethical) The Csuka class is a domestic modification of the Italian Adua class. The 600 tons of water displacement vessels were perfectly compatible with the Hungarian fleet in military operations in the Mediterranean."
HUN_submarine_3:0 "Süllö Class"
HUN_submarine_3_desc:0 "(Hypotethical) The need for a long-range submarine capable of deploying missiles arose within the fleet, and thus, the design of the Süllö class was born. The proposed Italian plans were not considered adequate, so they bought the Type VIIC plans from the German Government and somewhat modified them to better suit the needs of the fleet."
HUN_submarine_4:0 "Harcsa Class"
HUN_submarine_4_desc:0 "(Hypotethical) A radically modernized version of the Süllö class, the hull and battery capacity of which have been extended. Members of the class were able to reach relatively high speeds on the surface as well as submerged."
