 #Hungarian decisions
 HUN_slovakian_self_governance:0 "Slovakian Self-Governance"
 HUN_slovakian_self_governance_desc:0 "The Slovakian people living in our country are't entirely content with the central government. We could potentially alleviate this problem, by granting them some amount of autonomy."
 HUN_carpatho_ukarinian_self_governance:0 "Carpatho-Ukarinian Self-Governance"
 HUN_carpatho_ukarinian_self_governance_desc:0 "Carpathian Ruthenia is predominantly inhabited by Ruthens, or Rusyns. This ethnic group has lived under Hungarian rule for a long time, and have never enjoyed much autonomy. After the Great War, they made attempts to proclaim a local government, but were eventually annexed into Czechoslovakia. By granting them some autonomy, we could perhaps win more of them for our cause."
 HUN_transylvanian_self_governance:0 "Transylvanian Self-Governance"
 HUN_transylvanian_self_governance_desc:0 "Transylvania has, for most of its history, enjoyed some autonomy, even within the Kingdom of Hungary. Its people desire a government of their own, even if within the bounds of our country."
 HUN_grant_autonomy_to_the_szeklers:0 "Grant Autonomy to the Szeklers"
 HUN_grant_autonomy_to_the_szeklers_desc:0 "The Szeklers are a relatively large group of ethnic Hungarians in Transylvania. Since they are surrounded by other nationalities, they have naturally developed a need for self-government. We could grant their wish, and give Szeklerland autonomy, so that they'd have a government that looks after their interests."
 HUN_join_slovakia_and_carpathian_ruthenia:0 "Join Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia"
 HUN_join_slovakia_and_carpathian_ruthenia_desc:0 "The autonomous governments of Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia can do little on their own. If the two states were joined under one government (still under our protective wings, naturally), they could grow to be a more potent actor on the world stage."
 HUN_create_slovakia_ruthenia:0 "Create Slovakia-Ruthenia"
 HUN_create_slovakia_ruthenia_desc:0 "The Ruthenians living in the newly created, joint Slovakian state have not yet embraced their new nation. To speed this process along, we could artificially engineer a state, in which tehy are considered as equals to the Slovaks. The state would function in a similar way, as Czechoslovakia, only this time it would last."
 HUN_settle_the_sobrance_dispute:0 "Settle the Sobrance Dispute"
 HUN_settle_the_sobrance_dispute_desc:0 "Sobrance, a small province on the borders of Carpathian Ruthenia and Slovakia has become disputed land recently. Both countries claim, that it is theirs by right, and since they both enjoy our protection, it comes to us to arbitrate in this matter."
 HUN_slovenia_for_burgenland:0 "Slovenia for Burgenland"
 HUN_slovenia_for_burgenland_desc:0 "Slovenia has been part of Austria for a long time, and they surely wish to have it back. Just as we would like to get Burgenland back from Austria. We could perhaps negotiate a deal with the Austrian government, and get everyone their rightful lands back."

 HUN_choose_a_successor_for_horthy:0 "Choose a Successor for Horthy"
 HUN_choose_a_successor_for_horthy_desc:0 "The regent is becoming old, and frail. His health could start to worsen any day, and the matter of his title after his death is far from settled. We could elect a successor to his position, so that everyone (including Horthy) can rest easy, knowing that his succession is secured."
 HUN_renounce_claims_towards_croatia:0 "Renounce Claims Towards Croatia"
 HUN_renounce_claims_towards_croatia_desc:0 "Croatia has been a part of Hungary for a long time, though always somewhat separated. Perhaps now that they finally have their own state, it is time to let them guide their own fate, and renounce our claims towards their territory."
 HUN_fight_for_transylvania:0 "Fight for Transylvania"

 HUN_apply_for_miedzymorze_membership_desc:0 "Our old friends, the poles, have founded their own alliance between the two great powers of Europe. If we don't want to join either of these two powers, perhaps we'd do best to seek the protection and friendship of Poland, and apply for membership in their alliance."
 HUN_apply_for_membership_in_the_novus_imperium_romanum:0 "Apply for Membership in the Novus Imperium Romanum"
 HUN_apply_for_membership_in_the_novus_imperium_romanum_desc:0 "Mussolini's Italy seeks to restore the glory of the Roman Empire, and they seek allies that would help them to do so. We could try to seek protection from them, and apply for membership in this new faction of theirs."
 HUN_free_the_austrian_workers:0 "Free the Austrian Workers"
 HUN_free_the_austrian_workers_desc:0 "The communist party in Austria has refused to join our proposed federation. This means, that we will have to forcibly free the Austrian proletariat, as their so called leaders refuse to break their chains."

 HUN_offer_union_to_poland:0 "Offer Union to Poland"
 HUN_offer_union_to_poland:0 "Poland is getting ever closer to defeat, and with them out of the war, we would likely not last long. We will offer a political union to them, to keep the Polish fighting. Our nations have been united during the middle ages several times, and friendship between our peoples has been strong ever since.

 HUN_the_arpad_line:0 "Construct The Árpád Line"
 HUN_the_arpad_line_desc:0 "At one point or another, we have to consider the possibility of a Soviet attack from the east. The red army has to be stopped right at our doorstep, the Carpathian mountains, otherwise they will quickly advance through our country. The terrain in Carpathian Ruthenia is perfectly fit for the construction of a strong defensive line, which shall be known as the 'Árpád Line', after the head of Hungarian tribes, Árpád."
 HUN_eastern_extension:0 "Eastern Extension of the Árpád Line"
 HUN_eastern_extension_desc:0 "We are now well defended from the northeast, but the newly acquired region of Transylvania lies defenseless. The Árpád Line needs to be extended to the southeast, all the way through the Eastern Carpathians, if we hope to defend against the red army."
 HUN_southern_extension:0 "Southern Extension of the Árpád Line"
 HUN_southern_extension_desc:0 "The Árpád Line is weak from the south, and in the case of an attack from the Wallachian plains, it would fall quickly. The line needs to be extended towards the southern borders of Transylvania."
 HUN_northern_extension:0 "Northern Extensionof the Árpád Line"
 HUN_northern_extension_desc:0 "If we were to be attacked from the north, the Árpád Line could be easily circumvented and attacked from the rear. To prevent such a calamity, we should expand the line in the northern Carpathians."
 HUN_establish_the_kingdom_of_ukraine:0 "Establish the Kingdom of Ukraine"
 HUN_establish_the_kingdom_of_ukraine_desc:0 "Ukraine has been oppressed under Russian rule for too long. We now have the means to free them of occupation, and Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg, a relative of the last Habsburg emperor is still sympathetic to the Ukrainian cause. We could help him form a new government in our recently acquired Ukrainian territories."
 HUN_propose_polish_axis_membership:0 "Propose Polish Axis Membership"
 HUN_propose_polish_axis_membership_desc:0 "Poland is very much in danger of being swallowed between its neighboring great powers.
